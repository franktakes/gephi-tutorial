# Gephi Tutorial for Graph/Network Visualization
Last updated Summer 2024 for Gephi version 0.10.1

## About this tutorial
This tutorial provides an introduction to [Gephi]{https://gephi.org}, an open source tool for visualizing graphs, also referred to as (social) networks.
It was originally written as part of the week 1 lab session of the [Social Network Analysis for Computer Scientists](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~takesfw/SNACS/) course in the MSc Computer Science programme of Leiden University, but should be reusable for any data-savvy researcher or practitioner. 
All credit for the Gephi tool itself goes to the original authors.

For example, after 
Still, without understanding these concepts in detail, it should be possible to follow the tutorial.
