# Gephi Tutorial for Graph/Network Visualization

## About this tutorial
This tutorial provides an introduction to Gephi, an open source tool for visualizing graphs, also referred to as (social) networks.
It was originally written as part of the week 1 lab session of the Social Network Analysis for Computer Scientists course in the MSc Computer Science programme of Leiden University, but should be reusable for any data-savvy researcher or practitioner. 

### Prior knowledge 
On the data side, the tutorial assumes familiarity with CSV files and their manipulation. 
Conceptually, it is assumed that at least some exposure to common network science / network analysis concepts such as graph/network, nodes, edges, degree, centrality and community structure has been attained. 
Still, without understanding these concepts in detail, it should be possible to follow the tutorial.
