# Gephi Tutorial for Graph/Network Visualization
Last updated Summer 2024 for Gephi version 0.10.1

## About this tutorial
This tutorial provides an introduction to [Gephi](https://gephi.org), an open source tool for visualizing graphs / networks.
It is commonly used for data analysis and research in, e.g., (social) network analysis, complex networks / network science and data science. 
The tutorial was originally written as part of the first week lab session of the [Social Network Analysis for Computer Scientists](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~takesfw/SNACS/) semester course of 6 ECTS in the [MSc Computer Science](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/computer-science) programme of [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). 
While intended as a companion for an introductory network science lecture, the tutorial is by now likely useful for any data-savvy researcher or practitioner. All credit for the Gephi tool itself goes to the original authors.

### Prior knowledge 
The tutorial assumes familiarity with CSV files and their manipulation; it is, comparatively, rather data-centered. 
Conceptually, it is assumed that at least some exposure to common network analysis concepts such as nodes, edges, degree, centrality and community structure has taken place. 
Still, without understanding these concepts in detail, it should be possible to follow the tutorial and enjoy the beauty of networks and their visualizations.
